Challenges
1) I had questions about how Terraform advises to break down infra in the project- I looked at an example that had this way of breaking out the infrastructure (the way I work with the CDK) making it easier to use repeatable constructs or scripts with different projects.  Breaking out into networking,IAM,logging, etc just makes sense. 

2) Wondering if there are any VSCode extensions that are widely used in order to view the code better.  I'm sure with a quick google I can find that but  was curious what you guys use or what industry standard is.

3) Other challenges was bassically lack of knowledge around Terraform(ie varaibles, cross config variables, etc)
